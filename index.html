      <h4>What is JavaScript ?</h4>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight
        and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations
        allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic
        pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented
        capabilities.
      </p>
      <h5>Client-Side JavaScript</h5>
      <p>
        Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The
        script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the
        code to be interpreted by the browser. It means that a web page need not
        be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user,
        control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content. The JavaScript
        client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI
        server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if
        the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field. The
        JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if
        all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.
        JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button
        clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates
        explicitly or implicitly.

      <h4>Advantages of JavaScript</h4>
      <p>
        The merits of using JavaScript are − Less server interaction − You can
        validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This
        saves server traffic, which means less load on your server. Immediate
        feedback to the visitors − They don't have to wait for a page reload to
        see if they have forgotten to enter something. Increased interactivity −
        You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with
        a mouse or activates them via the keyboard. Richer interfaces − You can
        use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and
        sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

      <h5>Limitations of JavaScript</h5>
      <p>
        We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It
        lacks the following important features − Client-side JavaScript does not
        allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security
        reason. JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because
        there is no such support available. JavaScript doesn't have any
        multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.
